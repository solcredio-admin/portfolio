            <h3>Homelab</h3>
            <p>I've built and manage a DIY Network-Attached Storage (NAS) system at home, where I handle server configuration, automated backups, and network security. This project has helped me gain practical experience with virtualization, file management, and optimizing storage solutions for reliability and efficiency.</p>

            <h3>Portfolio</h3>
            <p>I designed and maintain my personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and ongoing learning. I implemented responsive design, organized content for easy navigation, and integrated basic interactive features to enhance user experience. This project reflects my focus on both design and functionality in web development.</p>
